Using the Dos 4.00 partition swapper.

1. You must add the swapper, swapper.exe, to the autoexec.bat file.  Add
   the following lines:

	memset default = 5
	detach swapper
	memset default = 127

   This allows the swapper to run in a minimum amount of space.

   Note the swapper MUST run in backround.

2. The above configuration will cause the swapper to default to the
   root directory of c: drive for locating its swap files.  You may
   tell the swapper where to place the swap files by specifying
   the drive and also the directory.  You must always specify the
   drive and the swapper will default to the root directory of the
   drive.  Example:

	detach swapper d:
   or
	detach swapper c:\tmp

3. The swapper will manage the cleanup of its swap files.  If the
   swap directory is changed after a system crash, there is the
   chance that swap files will be left around.  These can be removed
   by executing the following on the "old" swap directory:

	del *.swp

Currently ANY task can be swapped, so use with caution until this is
resolved.  If you don't want to have swapping, then remove "detach
swapper" from the autoexec.bat file.
