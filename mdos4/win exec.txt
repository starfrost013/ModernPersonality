AL = 00 (Immediately execute)
226B+0206 = program name (yep)
226B+026A


WIN.COM exec block:
part of env copy into child proc environment	2261
ptr to command tail (ds:si???)			226B:0080
first fcb (copy into child's psp)		226B:005C
second fcb (copy into child's psp)		226B:006C


[rest is irrelevant according to docs,
as AL=00h and process SS:SP and CS:IP don't matter...because that's load don't execute]


psp = Program Segment Prefix
DOES NOT EXIST ON MDOS4!!!!!!!!! ONLY PTDA BUT IT SHOULD BE COMPATIBLE!!!
