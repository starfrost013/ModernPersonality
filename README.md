## Research on Multitasking DOS 4.0, OS/2, and 16-bit Windows

This is the sum (as of September 8, 2023) of my research into the development of Multitasking MS-DOS 4.0 and OS/2 1.0 (which really ought to be called "Multitasking MS-DOS 5.0"...) from early 1983 to late 1987. 

The source code dated 1986 or early 1987 is from OS/2 1.0 build 7.68.17, which has kernel and BIOS source code in its slack space. 
This is a complete mess that grew organically; all IDA databases are 7.7 format, as far as I know.
